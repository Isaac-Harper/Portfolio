JUNO is the name of the QMK keymap I have written and is running on a SplitKB Kyria board. Iâ€™ve slowly added and modified many of the features that the software offers like OLEDs, rotary encoders, and mouse keys. 

## Features

- [Layers](#layers)
- [Tap dance](#tap-dance)
- [Encoders](#encoders)
- [OLED](#oled)
- [RGB Backglow](#rgb-backglow)
- [Gaming setup](#gaming)

### Layers<a name="layers"></a>

I have the folowing layers actives on Juno
- QWERTY
- SYM
- MOUSE
- MINECFT
- FACTORI
- FACTSYM

I'll talk about the last three in the gaming section so lets look at what each layer is trying to acomplish.

#### QWERTY

The QWERTY Layer is the base layer that is active when I use the board most of the time. It has qwerty keys in their normal layout
